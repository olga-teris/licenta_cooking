# Beef Stew

Beef Stew calls for simple ingredients, but it’s a stunner! With meltingly tender beef, you’ll love the deep flavour of the sauce in this beef stew recipe .


## Ingredients

- 1.2 kg / 2.4lb chuck beef 
- 1 tsp each salt and pepper
- 3 tbsp olive oil 
- 1 large onion 
- 4 garlic cloves 
- 3 carrots 
- 2 celery stalks
- 1/3 cup / 50g flour
- 3 cups / 750ml beef broth / stock
- 2 cups / 500 ml red wine 
- 2 tsp Worcestershire Sauce
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- 2 bay leaves , fresh or dried
- 4 sprigs thyme
- 400 g / 14 oz baby potatoes , halved
- More salt and pepper , to taste.


## Instructions

1. Sprinkle beef with salt and pepper.

2. Heat 1 1/2 tbsp oil in a large, heavy based casserole pot over high heat until just starting to smoke.

3. Add 1/3 of the beef and brown aggressively all over - about 4 minutes. Remove to bowl, repeat with remaining beef, adding more oil if required.

4. Turn down heat to medium high. Add 1 tbsp oil if required. Add onion and garlic, cook for 2 minutes until onion is softened slightly and golden on the edge.

5. Add carrot and celery, stir for 1 minute to coat in flavours.

6. Sprinkle flour evenly across surface, then stir to coat.

7. Add broth, red wine, tomato paste and Worcestershire sauce. Stir to dissolve tomato paste and flour into liquid.

8. Add cooked beef (including any juices), thyme, bay leaf and potato. Stir. Water level should almost fully cover everything (see video), if not, add a touch of water.

9. Bring to simmer, then adjust heat to low / medium low so it's simmering gently. (Note 3 for other cooking methods)

10. Cover and cook for 1 hour 45 minutes or until beef is pretty tender (check with 2 forks at 1.5 hrs).

11. Remove lid and simmer for further 30 minutes or until sauce reduces slightly. It should be like a thin gravy (see video) and beef should now be very tender.

12. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 


## Notes
Serve over creamy mashed potato with a sprig of fresh thyme for decoration or a sprinkle of parsley.
