# Blueberry Bread Loaf

This Blueberry Bread Loaf is an easy blueberry cake recipe that takes 10 minutes to prepare. The batter is made with yoghurt which makes this loaf lovely and moist, and all you need is a wooden spoon and one bowl. With a simple lemon glaze, this makes for a lovely afternoon tea!

Make this with any fruit you want – fresh, frozen or even dried!

## Ingredients

- 1 3/4 cups flour , plain / all purpose
- 1 cup white sugar , preferably caster/superfine
- 2 tsp baking powder
- Pinch of salt
- 1 cup plain yoghurt
- 3 large eggs , 55 – 60g / 2oz each
- 2 tsp lemon zest
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup canola oil (or vegetable, grapeseed oil)
- 2 tsp flour
- 1 1/2 cups frozen or fresh blueberries 
- 1 1/2 cups soft icing sugar / powdered sugar , sifted
- 2 tbsp lemon juice
- 1-2 tbsp milk 


## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 200°C/390°F (180°C fan forced).
2. Line loaf pan: Butter and line a loaf pan with parchment / baking paper. The picture pan is 21 x 11 x 7 cm (8.3 x 4.5 x 2.75") which makes a nice tall loaf.
3. Coat blueberries: Toss blueberries in flour (less flour sticks if dry, more if frozen). This helps keep them suspended in the batter.
4. Whisk Dry ingredients in a bowl.
5. Add Wet ingredinets: Make a well in the Dry ingredients. Add Wet ingredients. Whisk until incorporated.
6. Fold in blueberries: Fold in blueberries, including any flour remaining in the blueberry bowl.
7. Bake: Pour into the prepared tin. Bake for 50 minutes, then cover with foil. Bake for a further 15 – 25 minutes, or until a skewer comes out clean. Check after 15 minutes, then if the skewer comes out with batter on it, bake a further 10 minutes.
8. Cool: Rest for 5 minutes then turn onto a cooling rack and completely cool. Drizzle with Glaze. Wait until the glaze sets (about 20 minutes) before slicing to serve.
9. Whisk icing sugar and lemon until smooth, using milk only if needed to achieve the right thickness (Note 3). Pour or spread over cake set on a rack over a baking tray. Scrape glaze drippings on the tray back onto the cake.
