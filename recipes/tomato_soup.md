# Tomato Soup

This tomato soup recipe uses fresh tomatoes and will remind you of your mom's famous cooking. Sure the can of tomato soup works in a time crunch, but nothing beats the delicious flavors of a soup you made from scratch with fresh ingredients. So say goodbye to canned soup forever and hello to your new favorite tomato soup recipe.

## Ingredients

- 4 cups chopped fresh tomatoes
- 1 slice onion
- 4 cloves garlic
- 2 cups chicken broth
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons white sugar, or to taste


## Instructions

1. Gather all ingredients.

2. In a stockpot, over medium heat, combine the tomatoes, large slice of onion, garlic cloves, and chicken broth. Bring to a boil, and gently boil for about 20 minutes to blend all of the flavors.

3. Remove from heat and run the mixture through a food mill into a large bowl, or pan. Discard any stuff left over in the food mill.

4. In the now empty stockpot, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir in the flour to make a roux, cooking until the roux is a medium brown.

5. Gradually whisk in a bit of the tomato mixture, so that no lumps form, then stir in the rest.

6. Season with sugar and salt, and adjust to taste.

## Notes
Serve hot and enjoy!
