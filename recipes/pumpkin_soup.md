# Pumpkin soup

It’s just a great EASY Pumpkin Soup recipe, a classic version that has everything it needs and nothing it doesn’t to be can’t-stop-eating-it delicious!

## Ingredients

- 1.2kg pumpkin
- 1 onion, sliced
- 2 garlic cloves
- 3 cups (750ml) vegetable or chicken broth/stock
- 1 cup (250 ml) water
- Salt and pepper
- 125 – 185 ml cream

## Instructions

1. Cut the pumpkin into 3cm / 2.25" slices. Cut the skin off and scrape seeds out (video is helpful). Cut into 4cm / 1.5" chunks.

2. Place the pumpkin, onion, garlic, broth and water in a pot – liquid won't quite cover all the pumpkin. Bring to a boil, uncovered, then reduce heat and let simmer rapidly until pumpkin is tender (check with butter knife) – about 10 minutes.

3. Remove from heat and use a stick blender to blend until smooth (Note 3 for blender).

4. eason to taste with salt and pepper, stir through cream (never boil soup after adding cream, cream will split). 

5. Ladle soup into bowls, drizzle over a bit of cream, sprinkle with pepper and parsley if desired. Serve with crusty bread!


## Notes
Just a touch of cream adds a hint of luxury to this super easy pumpkin soup! If you don't have cream, use milk or add a knob of butter. Make this with any type of pumpkin OR butternut squash / butternut pumpkin (same thing!).
