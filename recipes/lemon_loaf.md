# Glazed Lemon Loaf

Glazed lemon loaf is what you make when you’re after something not too sweet that’s fuss-free to make. Lovely bright lemon flavour with buttery undertones, it’s a quick bread which means no yeast and easy to make. Excellent shelf life of 5 days!

## Ingredients

- 2 cups plain flour 
- 4 tsp baking powder 
- 1/8 tsp salt
- 1 cup plain yogurt 
- 2 large eggs 
- 75g / 5 tbsp unsalted butter , melted and cooled
- 1/4 cup vegetable or canola oil 
- 2 tbsp lemon zest 
- 1/4 cup lemon juice
- 1 1/4 cups caster sugar 
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 1/2 tsp lemon extract 
- 1 cup soft icing sugar/powdered sugar , sifted
- 3 – 3 1/2 tsp+ lemon juice


## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan-forced). Grease then line a 21 x 11 x 7 cm (8.5 x 4.5 x 2.75") with baking / parchment paper. (Note 4)

2. Batter – Whisk Dry ingredients in a large bowl. Whisk Wet ingredients in a separate bowl. Pour Wet ingredients into the Dry ingredients. Whisk just until lump free. Pour into the prepared loaf pan then smooth the surface.

3. Bake 45 minutes uncovered. Loosely cover with foil then bake a further 20 minutes or until a skewer inserted comes out clean.

4. Cool & glaze – Stand 10 min in pan then turn out onto a cooling rack. Fully cool before glazing (~3 hours). Use a spoon to spread and coax lovely glaze drips down the side! Cut thick slices and serve.

5. Glaze – Whisk ingredients until combined and smooth, a thick smooth frosting that will drip thickly, not be transparent. Start with 3 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice, and add 1/2 tsp extra, as needed. (Note 5 on thickness)


## Notes
Everybody loves the lemon glaze but it's also terrific without because you can toast it, slather with butter then drizzle with honey. SO GOOD!
