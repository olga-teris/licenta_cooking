# Sweet Potato Soup

A healthy dose of cumin plus a good amount of onion and leek keeps things interesting with this Sweet Potato Soup!


## Ingredients

- 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- 30g unsalted butter
- 2 onions
- 2 leeks
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1kg sweet potato
- 1 tbsp cumin powder
- 1 l chicken or vegetable stock
- 1.5 tsp kosher salt
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 1/3 cup cream


## Instructions

1. Heat the oil and melt the butter in a large heavy based pot over medium heat. Cook the onion, leek and garlic for 5 minutes until softened.

2. Add the sweet potato and cumin, cook for another 3 minutes, stirring regularly.

3. Simmer 20 minutes – Add the stock, salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer, then cook for 20 minutes at a gentle simmer until the sweet potato is very tender (no lid).

4. Remove the pot from the stove. Blitz with a hand-held stick until smooth. (Note 4 for blender) Stir in cream.

5. Ladle into bowls. Drizzle with yogurt, cream or olive oil with a sprinkle of something crunchy – pictured with pistachios and crispy flatbread strips (Note 3).


## Notes
Serve with a shower of something crunchy – croutons, nuts, crispy shallots. I used pistachios and flatbread ribbons, fried for speed, but they can be baked.
