# Mushroom Soup

This is a magnificent yet easy, creamy Mushroom Soup where you'll enjoy intense mushroom flavour with every mouthful! Forget whole mushrooms bits floating in a wan broth. Blending the soup releases all the gorgeous, earthy flavour locked up in the mushrooms into every luscious, creamy bite.

## Ingredients

- 30g unsalted butter
- 1 onion
- 2 garlic cloves
- 400g white mushrooms
- 3 1/4 cups vegetable stock
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/8 tsp black pepper
- 3/4 cup crème fraiche or cream
- parsley



## Instructions

1. Cut mushrooms into 4 slices, then dice into 3 or 4 pieces.
2. Melt butter in a large pot over medium high heat. Add onion and garlic. Cook for 3 minutes until softened, but not golden.
3. Add mushrooms and cook for 10 minutes, stirring regularly. Do not try to brown; they won't as the pot is too crowded but we do not need colour.
4. Simmer 15 min: Add vegetable stock, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then lower heat to medium and simmer gently for 15 minutes without a lid.
5. Stir in cream (or crème fraiche), then simmer for another 5 minutes.
6. Transfer to a blender (do in batches, if necessary). Remove the cap from the feeding hole in the blender lid (Note 5), cover the hole with a folded tea towel. Blend until completely smooth.
7. Return to pot, simmer for a minute or two until bubbles caused by blending largely subside and soup is hot.


## Notes
Ladle into bowls. Garnish with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil or cream, croutons and parsley or (if you're feeling a bit fancy), chervil. Don't forget bread for dunking!
